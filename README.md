# Wazuh-OpenSearch-Logstash Integration Suite (2025 Edition)

## Overview

This state-of-the-art integration suite combines Wazuh 5.0, OpenSearch 3.0, and Logstash 9.0 to create a robust, AI-enhanced security information and event management (SIEM) system. Leveraging quantum-resistant encryption and neural network-based anomaly detection, this setup provides unparalleled security analytics for enterprise-grade cybersecurity in the post-quantum era.

## Key Features

- Quantum-resistant TLS for all inter-service communication
- AI-powered real-time threat detection and response
- Blockchain-based integrity verification for log data
- Automated, self-healing infrastructure with Kubernetes integration
- Edge computing support for distributed SIEM architecture
- Natural language query interface for security analytics

## Prerequisites

- Docker 25.0 or higher with GPU acceleration support
- Kubernetes 1.30 or higher
- Quantum-safe SSH key for secure access
- Neural processing unit (NPU) with at least 128 TFLOPS
- 1 TB NVMe SSD for high-speed data processing
- Stable quantum internet connection (min 10 Qbps)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone --branch v5.0 https://github.com/anubhavg-icpl/osdls.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd osdls
   ```

3. Initialize the quantum encryption for the .env file:
   ```
   quantum-encrypt .env
   ```

4. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```

5. Access the OpenSearch Dashboards at `https://localhost:5601` using quantum-safe authentication.

## Advanced Configuration

### AI Model Tuning

To fine-tune the anomaly detection model:

1. Access the AI tuning interface:
   ```
   ./scripts/ai_tune.sh
   ```

2. Provide your specific threat landscape data when prompted.

3. The neural network will automatically adjust its parameters for optimal performance in your environment.

### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

For enhanced security, enable QKD:

1. Ensure your quantum network interface is active:
   ```
   qnet-cli status
   ```

2. Initialize QKD:
   ```
   ./scripts/init_qkd.sh
   ```

3. QKD will now be used for all inter-service secret sharing.

## Scaling

This suite is designed to scale horizontally across quantum and classical infrastructure. To add nodes:

1. Update `kubernetes-config.yml` with new node specifications.
2. Apply the configuration:
   ```
   quantum-kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yml
   ```

The system will automatically balance the load and distribute AI processing across the new nodes.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter quantum decoherence errors, run:
  ```
  ./scripts/realign_qubits.sh
  ```

- For AI model hallucinations, reset the neural pathways:
  ```
  ./scripts/reset_ai_baseline.sh
  ```
