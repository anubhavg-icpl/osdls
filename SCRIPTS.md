## Script Descriptions and Usage

### setup.sh

**Purpose:** Main setup script for initializing the entire Wazuh-OpenSearch-Logstash integration.

**Usage:**
```bash
./setup.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Checks for prerequisites (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Initializes the environment
- Calls other scripts to set up components (generate certificates, configure OpenSearch, etc.)
- Starts the Docker containers

### scripts/generate_quantum_certs.sh

**Purpose:** Generates quantum-resistant certificates for secure communication.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/generate_quantum_certs.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a new quantum-safe root CA
- Generates and signs certificates for each service
- Places certificates in the appropriate directories

### scripts/configure_opensearch.sh

**Purpose:** Configures OpenSearch with necessary settings and initializes AI models.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/configure_opensearch.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Waits for OpenSearch to be ready
- Creates required indexes and templates
- Initializes AI models for anomaly detection and natural language processing

### scripts/ai_tune.sh

**Purpose:** Fine-tunes the AI models used for anomaly detection and threat analysis.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/ai_tune.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Connects to the quantum neural network
- Prompts for threat landscape data
- Analyzes the data and adjusts AI parameters
- Updates and deploys the new AI model configuration

### scripts/init_qkd.sh

**Purpose:** Initializes Quantum Key Distribution for enhanced security.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/init_qkd.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if the quantum network is active
- Initiates the QKD process
- Distributes quantum keys to all services
- Updates service configurations to use QKD

### scripts/quantum_scale.sh

**Purpose:** Scales the infrastructure by adding new nodes to the quantum-classical hybrid cluster.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/quantum_scale.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Updates Kubernetes configuration with new node specifications
- Applies the new configuration to the cluster
- Rebalances the load across all nodes
- Redistributes AI processing tasks

### scripts/realign_qubits.sh

**Purpose:** Realigns qubits to resolve quantum decoherence issues.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/realign_qubits.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Detects quantum decoherence
- Analyzes the current quantum state
- Performs a multi-phase realignment sequence
- Verifies quantum coherence post-realignment

### scripts/reset_ai_baseline.sh

**Purpose:** Resets AI models to their baseline state in case of anomalies or hallucinations.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/reset_ai_baseline.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Disconnects AI from live data streams
- Purges current neural pathways
- Reinstates the baseline quantum neural network
- Reinitializes the AI knowledge base
- Performs sanity checks

## General Usage Notes

1. Ensure all scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. Always run scripts from the project root directory.

3. Some scripts may require sudo privileges or specific environment variables to be set.

4. It's recommended to run `setup.sh` first before using any other scripts.

5. Scripts interacting with quantum components (`init_qkd.sh`, `realign_qubits.sh`) require an active quantum network interface.

6. After making significant changes (e.g., scaling or AI resets), it's advisable to run `ai_tune.sh` to optimize the system for the new configuration.

Remember, these scripts are designed for a futuristic, advanced setup and may include speculative technologies. Adjust usage according to your actual system capabilities and requirements.
